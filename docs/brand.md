# Brand

This document is the source of truth for the product brand name and logo assets.

The brand is intentionally small, portable, and developer-friendly: a local AI coding environment in your pocket, represented by a sprout that is simple enough to work at 24px.

## Names

| Context             | Name        | Notes                                                                         |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Chinese brand       | 豆芽        | Primary Chinese name. Do not replace with synonyms.                           |
| English brand       | Doya        | Primary English name. Derived from 豆芽 / douya, but shortened for brand use. |
| Literal translation | Bean sprout | Meaning only. Do not use as the English product name.                         |

Use **豆芽** in Chinese-facing copy and **Doya** in English-facing copy.

Do not write `Douya`, `DoYa`, `DOYA`, `Bean Sprout`, or `BeanSprout` as product names unless a specific technical surface requires an identifier and the casing is documented there.

Runtime app copy must go through i18n:

- Use `brand.name` when a component needs to render only the brand name.
- Use `{brand}` inside translation strings when the brand appears inside a sentence.
- Do not hardcode `Doya` or `豆芽` in React components.

## Logo

The logo is a bean sprout mark. It should feel light, alive, and useful rather than cute, agricultural, or decorative.

Current app icon source:

- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya.svg` — primary filled 24x24 SVG with a full light-green background
- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-24.png` — derived 24x24 filled PNG
- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-app-icon.svg` — filled app/PWA icon source for surfaces that require a background

Supporting variants:

- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-mono.svg` — monochrome `currentColor` icon for UI chrome
- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-mono-24.png` — derived 24x24 monochrome PNG
- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-light.svg` — light-background tile variant matching the primary filled style
- `packages/app/assets/icons/doya-light-24.png` — derived 24x24 light-background PNG

The primary logo has a full light-green background. Use the filled mark by default.

Use the monochrome variant only when the mark must inherit surrounding UI color. Do not use transparent primary logo files for normal brand surfaces, and do not round the primary logo background if that would leave transparent corners.

## Color

Primary logo colors:

| Role       | Hex       |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Stem       | `#2E7D42` |
| Left leaf  | `#43C463` |
| Right leaf | `#9BDB45` |
| Seed       | `#D0A13A` |

The monochrome variant inherits `currentColor` and should be used when the mark needs to match surrounding UI text or icon color.

Avoid purple gradients, dark cyberpunk styling, beige/brown dominance, robot faces, and code-symbol clutter in brand marks. The sprout is the identity.

## Sizing

The source SVG uses a `24 x 24` viewBox and is designed to be legible at 24px.

Minimum practical sizes:

| Surface                   | Minimum                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| UI icon                   | 16px                                      |
| Toolbar or sidebar icon   | 20px                                      |
| Primary app/logo usage    | 24px                                      |
| Marketing or splash usage | Redraw/export from SVG at the target size |

At sizes below 20px, prefer the monochrome variant if the colored seed and leaves become visually noisy.

## Asset Workflow

Treat SVG files as source files. PNG files are derived artifacts.

When editing the primary logo, update the SVG first:

```bash
rsvg-convert -w 24 -h 24 packages/app/assets/icons/doya.svg -o packages/app/assets/icons/doya-24.png
```

When editing a variant, regenerate its matching PNG with the same dimensions:

```bash
rsvg-convert -w 1024 -h 1024 packages/app/assets/icons/doya-app-icon.svg -o packages/app/assets/images/icon.png
rsvg-convert -w 24 -h 24 packages/app/assets/icons/doya-mono.svg -o packages/app/assets/icons/doya-mono-24.png
rsvg-convert -w 24 -h 24 packages/app/assets/icons/doya-light.svg -o packages/app/assets/icons/doya-light-24.png
```

Do not hand-edit derived PNGs.

## Product Copy

Use the brand name plainly:

- Chinese: `豆芽`
- English: `Doya`

Acceptable short descriptions:

- Chinese: `把本地 AI 编程环境放进口袋`
- English: `Your local AI coding environment, in your pocket`

Keep product copy calm and concrete. Avoid mascot language, farming metaphors, and exaggerated agent autonomy claims.
